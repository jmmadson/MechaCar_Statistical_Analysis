## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
For this technical analysis we looked at Miles Per Gallon (mpg) and the effect that five additional variables had on it; Vehicle Length, Vehicle Weight, Spoiler Angle, Ground Clearance and AWD. We used linear regression and summary statistics to get the following output of the data:

From these summary statistics we can see that the Vehicle Weight, Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values as they have a p value of less than .05. This implies they have a significant impact on the MechaCar prototype miles per gallon. The other three variables all had a higher than .05 p Value, meaning they are more likely to provide random amounts of variance to the mpg. 

We can also see from the linear regression we performed that the slope of this linear model is not zero by looking at the value for the model, which is 5.35e-11.This provides sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  

The linear model analysis can effectively predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes as determined by the R-squared value of 0.7149 for this model. This shows that the regression model predicts 71% of the mpg.
